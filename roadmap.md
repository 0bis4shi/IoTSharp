# IoT# Roadmap

This roadmap communicates priorities for evolving and extending IoTSharp.

At present, our primary focus is enabling the following for IoTSharp:

* Multi-tenant devices and assets Management
* Collect and visualize data
* Process and React

As we complete those goals, we'll update our roadmap to include additional feature/capability areas we will focus on next.
